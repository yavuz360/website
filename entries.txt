title: Welcome to My New Blog System
type: current
date: 2024-09-12

This is my first post using the new single-file blog system! I can write naturally here without worrying about multiple files or complex formatting. The system automatically parses this content and displays it beautifully on my website.

I'm excited about this approach because it makes writing and editing so much easier. I can just open this one file, scroll to where I want to add content, and start typing. No more managing dozens of numbered files!

This post demonstrates the basic format with a title, type, and date header, followed by natural content writing.

title: Technical Deep Dive - Building a Single File Blog Parser
type: current
date: 2024-09-10

Today I worked on creating a JavaScript parser that can handle blog entries from a single text file. The challenge was designing a format that feels natural to write in while being easy to parse programmatically.

The key insight was using the

title: Why I Switched from Multiple Files to Single File
type: archived
date: 2024-09-05

Previously, I was using a system with numbered files like 001.txt, 002.txt, etc. While this worked, it had several drawbacks:

1. File management overhead - creating new numbered files
2. Difficult to reorder posts
3. Hard to see the full picture of my content
4. Version control showed many file changes instead of content changes

The single file approach solves all of these issues. Now I can:
- Write continuously in one place
- Easily reorder posts by cut and paste
- See my entire blog content at once
- Get clean git diffs that show actual content changes

This is much more maintainable and writer-friendly.

title: Future Plans and Ideas
type: current

I'm planning to build several enhancements to this blog system:

1. A Mac desktop app for easy blog editing with live preview
2. Support for markdown formatting within posts
3. Automatic cross-reference detection and linking
4. Tag-based filtering and search
5. RSS feed generation from the single file

The beauty of this system is that it's just a text file, so it's incredibly portable and future-proof. I can edit it with any text editor, version control it with git, and the parsing logic can evolve without breaking old content.

I'm also considering adding support for different post types like 'draft', 'featured', or custom categories.

title: Setting Up Local Development
type: archived
date: 2024-08-30

When developing this blog system locally, I ran into CORS issues when trying to fetch the blog file from JavaScript. The solution was to serve the files through a local HTTP server instead of opening them directly in the browser.

Here's what I learned about local development:
- Use `python -m http.server 8000` for quick local serving
- Place the entries.txt file in the same directory as your HTML files
- Update the baseUrl in your JavaScript to point to the local server
- Test both current and archived post filtering

This setup makes development much smoother and avoids cross-origin restrictions.
